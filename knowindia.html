Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.<br>
			Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere, the mainland extends between latitudes 8째 4' and 37째 6' north, longitudes 68째 7' and 97째 25' east and measures about 3,214 km from north to south between the extreme latitudes and about 2,933 km from east to west between the extreme longitudes. It has a land frontier of about 15,200 km. <br>
